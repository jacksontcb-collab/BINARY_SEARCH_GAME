## Steps to Run
Click the hugging face link and open the page
Start the space if it doesn't start automatically
Once it is running you should see a blank box as well as four buttons (Start new game, Higher, Lower, and correct)
Click start new game
Choose a number from the list the program generates (or one not on the list if you want to see what happens if your number isn't present)
The program will ask you if your number is higher or lower than the one suggested by the program.
Click if its higher or lower
Repeat until either your number is found or it says that your number isn't in the list
