## Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking (You can add a flowchart and write the
four pillars of computational thinking briefly in bullets)

Decomposition
- Split the game into steps: choose a range, pick a midpoint, compare, then adjust the range.

Pattern Recognition
-Notice that each guess cuts the search space in half.

Abstraction
-Ignore exact values and focus only on whether the target is higher, lower, or equal to the midpoint.

Algorithm Design
-Follow repeated steps: find midpoint, guess, update range, repeat until the number is found.

## Steps to Run
1. Click the hugging face link and open the page
2. Start the space if it doesn't start automatically
3. Once it is running you should see a blank box as well as four buttons (Start new game, Higher, Lower, and correct)
4. Click start new game
5. Choose a number from the list the program generates (or one not on the list if you want to see what happens if your number isn't present)
6. The program will ask you if your number is higher or lower than the one suggested by the program.
7. Click if its higher or lower
8. Repeat until either your number is found or it says that your number isn't in the list
